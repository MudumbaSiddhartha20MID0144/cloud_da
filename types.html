        <h1 >Service models of Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 2vw;">There are three main service models in cloud computing:</p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
            <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
            <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>In IaaS, cloud providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components on a pay-as-you-go basis. This allows businesses to avoid the cost and complexity of owning and managing physical servers.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></p>
        <p>PaaS provides a platform that allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. It includes development tools, database management systems, and other services to streamline the development process.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong></p>
        <p>SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access the software through a web browser without needing to install or maintain any software on their devices. Common examples of SaaS applications include email services, office productivity suites, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Understanding these types of cloud computing can help businesses choose the best model that suits their specific needs and requirements.</p>
